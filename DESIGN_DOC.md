High Concept
Gerson Run is a 2D vertical-scrolling, level-based running game where the player controls Gerson that must reach a specific distance goal in each level while avoiding hazards, defeating enemies, and collecting power-ups.

Core Design Pillars

1. Movement-First Gameplay
Movement is the core of Dino Relic Runner. Running, jumping, and dashing are the primary actions.
Enemies, hazards, and collectibles exist to test how well the player moves and reacts, not how complex their inputs are.

2. Readable Danger and Fair Failure
All hazards and enemies are clearly visible and behave consistently.
When the player fails, the cause is obvious (missed jump, mistimed dash, poor positioning), reinforcing learning instead of frustration.
