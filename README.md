# Game Title: Gerson Run
# Game Description
Gerson Run is a level based running game where the player
controls Gerson that runs forward and must reach a specific distance
goal to finish each level.

The player starts with three heart icons that represent their health.
Each time the player gets hit or fails, one heart is lost.

When all hearts are used, the player respawns at the last checkpoint.
Checkpoints are placed in each level to allow players to continue
from a saved position instead of restarting from the beginning.

If the player loses all hearts and no checkpoints are available,
the game will show the Game Over screen.

The player can also use a Dash-Attack ability to defeat enemies
or avoid hazards. This ability can only be used three times before
needing to be recharged through collectibles or checkpoints.

When the player reaches the required distance goal,
the Level Completed screen is shown and the player
can proceed to the next level.

Each level becomes more challenging as the distance increases,
requiring good timing, movement, and decision making.
